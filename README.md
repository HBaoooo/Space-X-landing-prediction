# SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction

## Overview
This is a project from IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The objective of the project is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance our understanding 
of the factors influencing successful rocket landings.
## Introduction
SpaceX has been at the forefront of space exploration, with reusable rocket technology playing a crucial role in reducing launch costs. This project aims to analyze data related to SpaceX rocket landings and develop a predictive model to forecast the success or failure of future landings. 
By understanding the patterns and variables affecting landing outcomes, we can contribute valuable insights to the space industry.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises historical data on SpaceX rocket launches, including information on launch date, mission outcome, booster landing success, and various other relevant parameters. 
The rocket launch data is requested from SpaceX API with the following URL: spacex_url="https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past"
## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
## Result
The results and insights obtained from this analysis are detailed in the Jupyter notebook. The predictive model's performance metrics are also presented, highlighting its accuracy and reliability in forecasting SpaceX rocket landing outcomes.
